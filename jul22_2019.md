Think of a character.

Character means person, but it also means the makeup of a person.

It can define a positive attribute all on its own - he has character.

Characteristic.


Orange lines against a black background, speckled white. If he looks close
enough, he can see that the blackness is actually white, infinite stars. Human
eye, allegedly, can see a single photon. So as long as one photon can hit his
eye...

But the photons nearby are more important than the ones that are from the
beginning of the universe. The orange lines, overlaid against his field of
vision. Calculated to be a color that draws his wandering attention. Lines
resolve into charts and diagnostics, seaweed and patches of oil, indecipherable.
He looks for the words. Words are good to look at. He can't help but read any
word that comes within his field of view.

Words resolve into meaning. "Error," "warning", "alert," seem redundant, given
that orange text means all those things. Are people color blind anymore? Can't
colorblind people see orange, anyway?

"Unknown," he reads, several times. Unknown, there's lots he's allowed to not
know, but there's nothing he can think of that his computer would *like* to
know, but *doesn't* know. Especially things it thinks worth bringing to his
attention in orange text. If it doesn't know, say, "cause of impact," as an
available example, or, "current location," how the hell should he?

He waves a hand to make the warnings go away. They persist, requiring
a second waving to clear the helm port. Real, bona-fide, fusion-generated
light might clear the picture up. Ahead, nothing but a trillion stars. He leans
forward in his seat, is stopped by a tight strap. Smacks the buckle in the
middle, leans forward further, cranes his head back to get a view above him.
His neck cracks in as many places as he can see stars. No fusion light, at least
none closer than a billion kilometers away.

He stands up, and a second later his head hits the ceiling. No acceleration
generating psuedo-gravity, then. Perhaps he is not even moving? Relative
to what though?
